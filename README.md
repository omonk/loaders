# MORE LOADERS!

![alt text](./loaders.gif)

A few very basic loaders I decided I wanted to put together, heavily (if not completely) inspired by Connor Athertons already stellar library [loaders.css](https://github.com/ConnorAtherton/loaders.css)

A complete work in progress for the time being.

CSS is still included in the .gitignore out of habit, once ready for general use it will be included once more.

To view for now without demo:

```
npm i
```
then

```
gulp sass
```

Repo currently has a small node server file included

```
node server.js
```
## TODO:

* Look into performance
* Breakout each animation into individual partials
* Add CSS to repo, remove gulp/package.json/any development tools
